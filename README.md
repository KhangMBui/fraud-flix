# Fraudflix
Project Fraudflix is our attempt at creating a netflix clone with limited content viewing capability. This clone will have no video functionality due to copyright restrictions, 
but users will be able to make personal accounts, search for content by title, and view content on a homepage sorted by genres. Admin accounts also exist and have functionality to 
manage user and content databases.
